# 0x07 Python - Test-driven development

This directory contains solutions to tasks and exercises related to Test-driven development (TDD) in Python.

## Description

In this directory, you'll find Python files that contain functions and programs developed using the Test-driven development methodology. Each task corresponds to a specific programming problem with its own set of requirements and constraints.

## Files

Here is a list of the files and their descriptions:

- **0-add_integer.py**: Contains a function that adds two integers.
- **2-matrix_divided.py**: Includes a function to divide all elements of a matrix.
- **3-say_my_name.py**: Contains a function that prints a first name and a last name.
- **4-print_square.py**: Includes a function to print a square with the '#' character.
- **5-text_indentation.py**: Contains a function to add newlines after specific characters in a text.

## Getting Started

To run or test the functions in these files, you can follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.5 and higher)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/0x07-python-test_driven_development.git


Usage
Navigate to the directory containing the files:

cd 0x07-python-test_driven_development


Run the individual Python files using the Python interpreter:

python3 file_name.py

python3 0-add_integer.py


Running Tests
Tests for these functions are provided in corresponding test files. To execute the tests, you can use the following command:

python3 -m doctest -v ./tests/test_file_name.py
