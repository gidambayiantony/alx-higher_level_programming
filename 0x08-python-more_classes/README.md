# 0x08 Python - More Classes and Objects

This repository contains Python programs and scripts that demonstrate concepts related to classes, objects, and object-oriented programming (OOP). Each script focuses on specific tasks to reinforce understanding and implementation of these concepts in Python.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to:

- Understand the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.
- Define and utilize classes and objects in Python.
- Comprehend the concepts of attributes, methods, and properties in Python classes.
- Explore the use of class and instance attributes, methods, and static methods.
- Implement special methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, etc.) and understand their purposes.
- Differentiate between public, protected, and private attributes.
- Utilize class methods and static methods effectively.
- Explore concepts like data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information hiding.
- Gain proficiency in handling instances, object deletion, and creating new instances dynamically.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. **0-rectangle.py**: Defines an empty class `Rectangle`.
2. **1-rectangle.py**: Defines a `Rectangle` class with private attributes and instantiation.
3. **2-rectangle.py**: Adds methods to calculate area and perimeter to the `Rectangle` class.
4. **3-rectangle.py**: Enhances the `Rectangle` class with string representation methods.
5. **4-rectangle.py**: Adds functionality to represent the object and recreate new instances using `eval()`.
6. **5-rectangle.py**: Implements instance deletion detection in the `Rectangle` class.
7. **6-rectangle.py**: Introduces a counter for the number of `Rectangle` instances created.
8. **7-rectangle.py**: Modifies the `Rectangle` class to support custom print symbols.
9. **8-rectangle.py**: Adds comparison functionality to determine the bigger rectangle.
10. **9-rectangle.py**: Extends the `Rectangle` class with a method to create squares.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Files must end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- All files should be executable
- Code should comply with `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*)
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`

## Usage

To test and run these scripts, execute them using Python interpreter:
```bash
python3 <filename.py>
