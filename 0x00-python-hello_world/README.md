# 0x00 Python - Hello, World

Welcome to the 0x00 Python - Hello, World project repository!

## Overview

This project serves as an introductory exploration into Python programming. It covers fundamental concepts and tasks designed to provide a solid foundation for working with Python.

## Project Structure

- **0-run**: Script files for executing Python code.
- **1-run_inline**: Script files to run Python code inline or in one line.
- **2-print.py**: Script file to print specific strings using Python's print function.
- **3-print_number.py**: Script file to print integer numbers using Python's print function.
- **4-print_float.py**: Script file to print float numbers using Python's print function.
- **5-print_string.py**: Script file to print a string multiple times using Python's print function.
- **6-concat.py**: Script file to concatenate strings in Python.
- **7-edges.py**: Script file to display specific characters from a string.
- **8-concat_edges.py**: Script file to manipulate and print specific parts of a string.
- **9-easter_egg.py**: Script file to print "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters.

Each task file contains a script that performs a specific Python-related task.

## How to Use

Navigate to each task's directory and execute the Python script using the command `python3 <script_name.py>`.

Example:
```bash
python3 0-run
