# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output

## Description
This repository contains solutions to various tasks related to input/output handling in Python. The project covers topics such as reading from and writing to files, working with JSON, and more.

Each task is implemented in a separate Python script file, adhering to the specified requirements and guidelines.

## Files
* [0-read_file.py](./0-read_file.py): Reads a text file and prints its content to stdout.
* [1-write_file.py](./1-write_file.py): Writes a string to a text file and returns the number of characters written.
* [2-append_write.py](./2-append_write.py): Appends a string at the end of a text file and returns the number of characters added.
* [3-to_json_string.py](./3-to_json_string.py): Returns the JSON representation of an object (string).
* [4-from_json_string.py](./4-from_json_string.py): Returns an object represented by a JSON string.
* [5-save_to_json_file.py](./5-save_to_json_file.py): Writes an object to a text file using a JSON representation.
* [6-load_from_json_file.py](./6-load_from_json_file.py): Creates an object from a JSON file.
* [7-add_item.py](./7-add_item.py): Adds all arguments to a Python list and saves them to a file in JSON format.
* [8-class_to_json.py](./8-class_to_json.py): Returns the dictionary description for JSON serialization of an object.
* [9-student.py](./9-student.py): Defines a Student class and retrieves its dictionary representation.
* [10-student.py](./10-student.py): Defines a Student class and retrieves its dictionary representation based on specified attributes.
* [11-student.py](./11-student.py): Defines a Student class, retrieves its dictionary representation, and reloads attributes from a JSON representation.
* [12-pascal_triangle.py](./12-pascal_triangle.py): Generates Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows.

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
* Files must end with a new line
* The first line of each file must be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* Code must comply with `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*)
* All files must be executable
* Tests executed using `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
* Proper documentation for modules, classes, and functions is required
