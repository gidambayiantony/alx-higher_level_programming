# 0x0C Python - Almost a Circle

This repository contains Python projects related to creating classes for basic shapes, focusing primarily on a class called Rectangle and a subclass Square.

## Description

The projects within this repository are part of the ALX Higher-Level Programming curriculum and aim to introduce object-oriented programming in Python. They cover the implementation of classes, inheritance, getter/setter methods, and more.

## Project Structure

The repository consists of the following main directories:

- **`models/`**: Contains Python class definitions for Rectangle and Square.
- **`tests/`**: Includes unit tests to validate the functionality of the implemented classes.

## Projects Included

- **`0-main.py`**: Main Python scripts to test the functionality of the implemented classes.
- **`tests/`**: Unit tests to ensure correct behavior of the classes and methods.

## How to Use

To test the functionality of these classes, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x0C-python-almost_a_circle.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd 0x0C-python-almost_a_circle

Run the tests:

python -m unittest discover tests
