# 0x05 Python Exceptions

This project focuses on learning about exceptions and error handling in Python programming. Exception handling is a crucial aspect of programming that allows developers to manage and respond to errors that occur during the execution of their code.

## Overview

The `0x05-python-exceptions` project covers the following key topics:

- Understanding what exceptions are in Python and how they differ from syntax errors.
- Exploring different types of built-in exceptions and their purposes.
- Using `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `raise` statements for handling exceptions gracefully.
- Learning about exception propagation and how exceptions propagate through function calls.
- Using `except` statements with multiple exceptions and creating custom exceptions.

## Project Files

The project includes a variety of Python scripts demonstrating the usage of exception handling techniques, such as:

- Scripts showcasing the handling of specific exceptions like `ZeroDivisionError`, `IndexError`, `TypeError`, etc.
- Examples demonstrating the use of `try-except` blocks in various scenarios.
- Implementations illustrating the use of `finally` blocks for cleanup actions.
- Scripts featuring the raising of custom exceptions for specific cases.

## Usage

To run the Python scripts within this project, simply execute them using a Python interpreter. For example:

```bash
python script_name.py
